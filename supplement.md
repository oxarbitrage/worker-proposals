# Alfredo Garcia - Supplemental worker - 1.14.X

Author: oxarbitrage

## Motivation

In the last 6 months worker for Alfredo Garcia in regards to development in the core and other areas(https://github.com/oxarbitrage/worker-proposals/blob/master/bitshares2018_1.md) was failing all the period in making the funds to cover the worker costs.

BTS price at the moment of creating worker was: 0,769230769 USD. Even with protection of 2.5 multiplier BTS was always below a limit of 0,30 USD. This is the price needed to cover this worker as it was created.

Worker was for 6 months at 6660 usd per month. 

This is a supplemental worker created to cover the debt, pay everything and end the contract. 

Alfredo Garcia, is not leaving Bitshares, on the contrary it is joining the bitshares-core team worker proposal.

## Transfers made inside this period:

The escrow of this worker only pulled money from the blockchain 3 times in the 6 months period:

alfredo-worker sent 4,800 USD to oxarbitrage.a699 1.11.151678027

alfredo-worker sent 3,000 USD to oxarbitrage.a699 1.11.167111927

alfredo-worker sent 5,998 USD to oxarbitrage.a699 1.11.196057968

Payments made until now:

6000 + 4800 + 3000 = 13,800

39,600(total 6 months) - 13,800(paid until now) = 25,800 USD of debt today.

## Current vesting:

Worker haves some BTS accumulated to pay part of the debt in vesting balances:

1,072.788 BTS - 1.13.1609 , 91.125 BTS - 1.13.1608 , 39,414.367 BTS - 1.13.4839 (around 40,000 BTS total in vesting)

If we buy usd today with what we have: 40,000 bts x 0,18(bts/usd price) = 7200 usd

Debt if we do that: 25,800 - 7,200 = 18,600

## Ending 2 weeks earlier:

The core team has proposed to end this worker earlier and join the core worker immediately, 2 weeks before the end of the contract.

means, 6600/2 = 3300 usd for the last month.

so instead of 39,600 the total for the worker is now 36,300 usd.

the 3 payments made:

6000 + 4800 + 3000 = 13,800

36300 - 13800 = 22200

assuming we buy 7200 usd today: 22200 - 7200 = 14,800 debt.

## Worker payment and duration:

We want to collect the needed funds and end at around the same time the initial worker was supposed to finish, pay all the debt and burn back what left.

`alfredo-worker` is an escrow account formed by the following bitshares community members(unchanged):
```
chainsquad
dev.bitsharesblocks
elmato
fox
lin9uxis
```
Start date: 2018-07-15
End Date: 2018-07-20

BTS Per day: 20000 BTS

At current rates of 0,18 USD per BTS supplemental worker will collect 100000 BTS that will be 18,000 USD. We only need 14,800 usd at today rates but we need to cover in case BTS price drops below.
All non used BTS will be burned back to the chain, escrow group is fully compromised on this.

The supplemental worker proposal was considered since the beggining at: https://github.com/oxarbitrage/worker-proposals/blob/master/bitshares2018_1.md#notes

The expiring worker was the most voted worker proposal in the history of bitshares, we hope the stakeholders that trusted on it  before understand the importance of this and approve this supplemental worker to cover the debt, this is a worker that we tried to avoid at all cost speculating on a recovery of the price that never happened.
